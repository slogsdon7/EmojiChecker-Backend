## Additional notes
- The developer environment is set to use sqlite for the database, even though we are using MySQL for production. Sqlite should be perfectly fine for development and requires zero configuration to get going.
- Certain settings, like the database and secret key are overridden in a production specific settings file. This will obviously not be committed to github.
